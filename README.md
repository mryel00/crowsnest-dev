## Why is it called crowsnest?

**It inherited his name from sailing ships crow's nest.**

> A crow's nest is a structure in the upper part of the main mast of a ship or a structure that is used as a lookout point. \
> See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow's_nest

So, this will be the 'lookout point' for your printer.

## Documentation

The crowsnest's documentation can be found at [https://crowsnest.mainsail.xyz/](https://crowsnest.mainsail.xyz/)

If there is something in our documentation that is not covered, is described in a way that is misunderstood, or simply is missing, please let us know!

---

## Compatibility

To be able to use all features and streamers you need a Raspberry Pi with a Raspberry Pi OS based image with at least Python 3.10.

For other systems we recommend Debian based images, as they come with `bash` and the `apt` package manager that we rely on for installation.

Non Debian based images are not officially supported and never will be.
